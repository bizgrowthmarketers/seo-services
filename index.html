        <h1 class="faq-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <!-- FAQ 1 -->
        <div class="faq-item" id="faq1">
          <div class="faq-question">
              <h2>What is SEO?</h2>

          <div class="faq-answer" id="answer1">
              <p>SEO, or <strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong>, is a digital marketing strategy designed to enhance a website's visibility on search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo.
              This is achieved through keyword targeting, creating relevant and engaging content, and building authoritative backlinks. The ultimate goal of SEO is to attract organic traffic and 
              improve the website's ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs).</p>
          </div>
      </div>

        <!-- FAQ 2 -->
        <div class="faq-item" id="faq2">

              <h2>How long does it take to see results from SEO?</h2>

          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer" id="answer2">
              <p>SEO is a long-term investment, and while some changes might be noticed within a few weeks, significant improvements typically take time. On average, 
                <strong>positive ranking movements are expected between three to six months.</strong> For keywords to consistently appear on the first page, it usually 
                takes around six to eight months. This time frame can vary depending on your industry, competition, and current website status.</p>
